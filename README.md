# NOTE
Some antiviruses may flag the binaries as a virus. I assure you it is **NOT** a virus. It is being flagged due to the way PyInstaller packs the program into an exe or such. If you really want, you may decompile the binaries using some PyInstaller decompiler and compare the code with the source (main.py) yourself.
